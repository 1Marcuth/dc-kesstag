        <h2>Heroic Races FAQ</h2>
        <h3>What does "Pool" mean in the Heroic Race?</h3>
        <p>In the Heroic Race, the "Pool" refers to the maximum number of items that are immediately available at the start of the mission. The Pool always starts off at its full capacity. As you start collecting items, a new item will be added to the Pool after a certain waiting period. If the Pool is empty, you will have to wait for it to refill before you can collect any new items. Remember, the Pool must have at least one item in it before you can collect any more. An empty Pool is the most common reason why players cannot collect more items.</p>
        <h3>What does "Wait time" mean?</h3>
        <p>"Wait time" is the amount of time required for a new item to be added to the Pool. This only matters when the Pool is not large enough to complete the mission in one go. The Pool will start regenerating new items as soon as you collect your first item. However, the cooldown will reset every time you collect an item. So, it's better to start any timers only after depleting the Pool completely.</p>
        <h3>What is "Min. Time"?</h3>
        <p>"Min. Time" is the calculation of the quickest time required for the Pool to refill enough to complete the mission. This calculation is (Required Items - Pool) * Wait Time. Once you empty the Pool, start a timer, and wait for this calculated time for the items to regenerate.</p>
        <h3>Keep track of these statistics</h3>
        <p>Use this guide to keep track of how many items are left in the Pool and how long it will take to get enough items to complete your mission. These important factors are not explained in the game, and an empty Pool is the most common reason why players cannot collect any more items.</p>
        <h2>Heroic Races Tips</h2>
        <h3>What is the best way to collect gold for Heroic Race tasks?</h3>
        <p>The best way to collect gold is by having more habitats. Each time you collect gold, there is a chance to collect an item. You also have a higher chance of collecting gold when your habitat is full of gold, which is visible when the gold icon is no longer see-through. Collecting gold is one of the easiest tasks to complete in the Heroic Race. Having more habitats means more chances to get items from collecting gold.</p>
        <p>Another way to quickly increase the amount of gold you can collect is to power up your dragons. You can save your powerups for the tasks in the Heroic Race that require you to power up dragons. But you should prioritize dragons that give the most gold per minute. Note that once a dragon's level increases above level 10, the increase in gold per level halves. Your rarest dragons usually will pay the most gold per minute.</p>
        <p>You can also try to focus on habitats like Terra habitats, which get full quicker, but it's not always the best strategy because it's not great once the Heroic Race ends!</p>
        <h3>What is the best way to collect food for Heroic Race tasks?</h3>
        <p>The best way to collect food is by buying the cheapest option over and over again. Each time you collect food, there is a chance to collect an item. Therefore, buy the 50 gold option in every food farm and do it as fast as possible! You have a higher chance of getting items the more food you purchase, but bigger foods take much longer to grow and claim. That's why it's advised to always use the 50 gold option called "Backyard Gardener." Collecting food more often means more chances to get items from collecting food.</p>
        <p>If you still want to grow large food options, consider buying one very expensive food option that takes 9, 12, or 24 hours. Meanwhile, you can use every other farm to cycle the 50 gold food collection.</p>
        <h3>What is the best way to breed dragons for Heroic Race tasks?</h3>
        <p>The best way to breed dragons is to use Terra + Terra. It may take many tries and failed attempts, but it's the quickest way to get multiple items. Once you've bred the Terra + Terra dragons,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can sell the egg after the hatch time (if you don't need hatching items)</li>
            <li>Or place them on Terra habitats, which can be powered up later too.</li>
            <li>For each item, expect to breed up to 30-40 times. It takes a lot of attempts! The alternative is to use the slower way with long breeds to guarantee an item, but other players might overtake you while you do this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Long-term goal: Try to unlock the three available breeding areas when they become available via gems from completing rewards/surveys (this can take a long time - or you could spend money, but that is not a great use of money). Breeding more often means more chances to get items from breeding.</p>
        <p>If you manage to unlock all of the breeding buildings and all slots on the hatchery, place them all near each other (this will be near the second island due to the breeding sanctuary).</p>
        <h3>What is the best way to hatch dragons for Heroic Race tasks?</h3>
        <p>The best way to hatch dragons is to use Terra + Terra that you've bred. Again, it will take many tries and failed attempts, but it's the quickest way to get multiple items. For each item, expect to hatch up to 30-40 times. It takes a lot of attempts. Otherwise, the slower way is to use other long eggs to guarantee an item, but other players might overtake you. Try to unlock the three available breeding areas and the upgraded hatchery (5 eggs at once)</p>
